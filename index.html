            <div class="secondleft text">I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain. </div>

            we speak now of the Muad'Dib who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: "I am the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough."

Shai Hulud, the mighty sandworms of Arrakis, epitomize the unforgiving nature of the desert. Silent giants, they dwell beneath the dunes, guarding the precious spice melange. Revered as sacred creatures, their colossal presence embodies both awe and dread, shaping the fate of those who dare to traverse their arid realm.
